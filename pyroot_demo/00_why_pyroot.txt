I have use ROOT (C++) for a while.
Why learning PyROOT ?

1.  in general, Python is easier to learn than C++ for a beginner.
    and code also shorter and cleaner.
    Python provides very nice build in function, ex. range()
    iPython is another reason.

2.  PyROOT's syntax is very similar to ROOT's. 
    (But you still need to know some C++ basics ) 

3.  When you install ROOT, by default, you also install PyROOT.




For me, most of my analysis is done in ROOT,
but recently, I start to investigate how to use PyROOT, 
and I find PyROOT is very useful to do quick analysis.

What I will cover in this PyROOT tutorial series are
(1) basic histogram handling
(2) basic fit
(3) basic TFile
(4) basic TTree
I think these cover the most essential tools for the analysis ( at least for me.)

Which ROOT version I use 6.12

What I skip:
(1) ROOT installation  
see my previous tutorial at

(2) iPython installation
